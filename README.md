# MONIKA
Model for Organizing Neural Interactions and Knowledge Affectively

MONIKA aims to develop affective virtual agents capable of organic interpersonal relationships and interactions with human users. Its intended purpose is for agents who internalize emotional responses to events (based on the agent's personal goals, values, and knowledge) and then seek to remedy negative emotions while pursuing positive emotions.
